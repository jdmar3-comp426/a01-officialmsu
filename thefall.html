                Now that Daedalus and Icarus were in flight, things seemed to be going well.

                They had escaped the labyrinth and were on their way to freedom - or so they thought. In the midst of their flight, Icarus forgot his father's words of wisdom and became curious. He began to fly higher and higher, closer and closer to the sun.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="maintext">
                As Icarus flew closer and closer to the sun, the sun began to melt the wings on his back. Slowly but surely, the wax holding the feathers together became to melt, causing the feathers to fall off. Once the feathers were completely gone, Icarus fell into the sea, plunging to his death.
                Daedalus was heartbroken after seeing this, and wept bitterly for his son. Daedalus had gained his freedom, but lost his son. And from that moment onwards, the story about the boy who flew too close to the sun was remembered and passed down.
