                After Daedalus built the labyrinth for the sole purpose of imprisoning the Minotaur on the island of Crete, a brave hero named Theseus arrives on the scene.
            </h3>
            <h5>
                Theseus has one mission: Kill the Minotaur and escape the labyrinth.
                
            </h5>
            <br/>
            <h5>
                With the help of Daedalus and Ariadne's thread, Theseus successfully completes his mission and escapes. 
                Once Theseus escaped, he left with Ariadne and both of them escaped the island of Crete. 
                King Minos (the father of Ariadne) was deeply angered by this, and as punishment, he imprisoned Daedalus and his son Icarus inside the labryinth.
                Although it seemed like there was no escape, Daedalus had one last plan. After all, he is a genius inventor, and he had one last trick up his sleeve.
