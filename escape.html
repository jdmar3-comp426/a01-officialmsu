                Hard at work on an escape plan, Daedalus comes up with one of his most genius inventions.

                Using the feathers of birds and wax, Daedalus was able to thread the feathers together to create wings.

            <h5 id="maintext">
               When attached to the body, the wings would allow Daedalus and Icarus to fly away and escape their prison.
               There was only one caveat however: if either Daedalus or Icarus flew too close to the sun, the wax holding the feathers together would melt, and the wings would fall apart.
               With this in mind, both Daedalus and Icarus put on their wings and flew away out of the prison.
